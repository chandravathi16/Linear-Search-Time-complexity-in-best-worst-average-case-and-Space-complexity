# Linear Search: Time complexity in best,worst,average,case and Space complexity
## Searching 
# 1) Linear Search :
       Finding an element in the array/list.
# Working process:
    In Linear Search,
       #Traverse the array comparing the elements consecutively one after the other until the element found.
       #A sequential loop comparing each element in the array.
       #If any index matches then return 'element is found' at so and so index.
       #else return 'element is not found'. 

*Time complexity :           
# a)Best case = O(1)          
# b)Worst case = O(n)
# c)Average case = O(n)

Average number of comparisions = (n+1)/2

*Space complexity :
O(1)
