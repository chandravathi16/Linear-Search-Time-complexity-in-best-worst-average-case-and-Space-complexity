
# Time Complexity mean
The amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its execution.
# Space Complexity mean
The amount of memory space required to solve the problems.

## Searching 
1) Linear Search :
          Finding an element in the array/list.
   Working process:
          In Linear Search,
             ->Traverse the array comparing the elements consecutively one after the other until the element found.
             ->A sequential loop comparing each element in the array.
             ->If any index matches then return 'element is found' at so and so index.
             ->else return 'element is not found'. 

*Time complexity             *Space complexity
a)Best case --> O(1)          O(1)
b)Worst case --> O(n)
c)Average case --> O(n)

Average number of comparisions = (n+1)/2
